                                       <p>1 in 3 in South Sudan is Illiterate. Between 2011 and 2015 than 100 schools were completely ravaged
                                       by targeted aerial bombardments and ground. Today, many classrooms are still conducted under
                                     trees and in dilapidated classrooms, Schools and teachers have no access to books with which to teach. </p>

                               <p> In response this urgent need we want to Donate 1 million books to schools in the region in 5 years
                                By Donating books to us, you are supporting our work to eradicate illiteracy and poverty in the Nuba Mountains, surrounding Regions and
                                 Africa as a whole. We are Setting up new up schools and libraries to bring education and knowledge to more people.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                      <h4>Why Donate Books</h4>
                                        <br>
                                            <ol>
                                            <li>Books improve community literacy standards. We run volunteer led reading and writing programs to improve community literacy standards </li>
                                            <li> Donating Books will mean a reduced student teacher ratio and promote equitable access to learning resources removing distance to education and other home constraints.</li>
                                              <li>More books Promote equal and equitable access to learning resources ranging. knowledge gained from reading books will empower communities to self innovate and fight hunger and poverty </li>
                                              <li> Donating used books to us, is not only environmentally friendly, it means freeing up more space for more important things </li>
                                                <li> Books provide an opportunity to create an environment where students can read for pleasure, enrich their intellectual curiosity and enhance emotional growth </li></ol>

                                        <h4> Why Hope Library</h4>
                                         <br>

                                        <p> We chose " Hope" Because Hope represents Optimism. We see the Optimism in the WILL AND DETERMINATION of the Nuba People to be free and prosperous. We this as only being possible if they have the knowledge to attain Economic Freedom </p>
                                          <p>The Hope Library project is culmination of so many Nuba People's dream to educate and build well informed communities in order to solve their own Problems.
                                          It is also a core part of our strategy to build for sustainability.</p>
                                          <p> We want to use the library as a conduit for building connected communities through face-to-face learnign and interaction. Hope Library will be an Excellence centre for the
                                          community on a myriad of subjects ranging from Business and Entrepreneuership, Science and Technology, as well as Literacy and the arts.
                                          By building the Hope Library will run volunteer led reading and writing classes as well as inititives focused on girl education, and female empowerment because women
                                          are disseminators of knowledge. Where women succeed, everyone succeeds </p>
                                    <p> In addition, Hope library will also be used as  central point for our book lending programs to schools and the Community. </p>
                                              <br>
                                            <h4>Culture</h4>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Culture is an important aspect of individual and collective identity. Our program offers safe spaces for refugees and migrants to participate in various art
                                          forms like poetry and storytelling, dance, singing, music, drawing, painting and theater. We teach the youth to learn how to express their emotions in new and creative ways. Skills learned such as decision-making, communication, self-awareness and problem solving empower the youth and enable them to have a voice.</p>
