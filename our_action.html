                                        <h4> Why Hope Library</h4>
                                        <p> We chose " Hope" Because Hope represents Optimism. We see the Optimism in the WILL AND DETERMINATION of the Nuba People to be free and prosperous.
                                          Prosperity is possible if the people have the knowledge to attain Economic Freedom. Hope Library represents that Possibility. </p>
                                          <p> We want to use the library as a conduit for building connected communities through face-to-face learning and interaction.
                                          By building the Hope Library we can run volunteer led reading and writing classes as well as inititives focused on girl education, and female empowerment because women
                                          are disseminators of knowledge. Where women succeed, everyone succeeds </p>
                                  <br>
