                                          We teach the youth to learn how to express their emotions in new and creative ways. Skills learned such as decision-making, communication,
                                          self-awareness and problem solving empower the youth and enable them to have a voice.</p>

                                        <p>We assist the youth to develop critical thinking through self advocacy, community advocacy and societal advocacy training. They gain leadership skills, interpersonal and digital skills to tackle some of the biggest issues affecting them. We bring together policy advocates, thought leaders, change makers, and some of the sharpest minds in today's world to tackle some of the most pressing issues affecting refugees and migrants. By sharing their experiences young people are able to bring to bear issues that matter to them.</p>
